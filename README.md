linux is my home with neovim and tmux being my favourite neighbours.

find my neovim config [here](https://github.com/Theoreticallyhugo/nvim).

for my work as maintainer on the best tmux plugin there is, check out [Dracula/tmux](https://github.com/dracula/tmux).

LaTeX is awesome! script for easy compilation and project management coming soon...
